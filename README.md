### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a fifth-year PhD student advised by Prof. Philip S. Yu in the [BDSC](https://bdsc.lab.uic.edu/index.html) Lab. My previous research (before March 2019) focuses on adversarial training and its applications, and currently, I am mainly studying Conversational AI. My mission is to create accurate and smart dialog systems.
